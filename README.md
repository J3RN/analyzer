# analyzer

A tool that allows you to query a call-graph.

## Usage

This tool accepts the call-graph as a CSV (e.g. generated by [viz](https://github.com/j3rn/viz)) with just a `source` and `target` column.

### Commands

#### paths

```
$ analyzer paths <csv> <source> <target>
```

Lists all of the code paths from `<source>` to `<target>`.

#### callers

```
$ analyzer callers <csv> <callee>
```

Lists all of the functions that call `<callee>`.

#### dependents

```
$ analyzer dependents <csv> <callee>
```

Lists all of the functions that call `<callee>`, recursively.

#### callees

```
$ analyzer callees <csv> <caller>
```

Lists all of the functions `<caller>` calls.


#### dependencies

```
$ analyzer dependencies <csv> <caller>
```

Lists all of the functions `<caller>` calls, recursively.

## Building

This project is written in Haskell and uses [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/).  Once you have Stack installed and the project cloned to your machine, you should be able to build the project by running `stack build` in the project directory.  To install the project to your `~/.local/bin`, run `stack install`.
